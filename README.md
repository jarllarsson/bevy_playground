My Bevy Playground
---
Playing around with Bevy and Rust, learning, failing... borrow checking...?

Each file is probably going to be its own contained test.
Run with ``cargo run --project name``

Using custom build.rs script from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57535794/how-do-i-include-a-folder-in-the-building-process to get any pesky assets in the right place on build.
